# Handwriting-recognition-Using-CNN-BiLSTM-CTC
This project integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM), and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for accurate handwriting recognition. The aim is to precisely transcribe handwritten words into machine-readable text, employing a synergistic approach for effective sequence labeling.
